# BYU AMP Theme
> Subtheme of [AMP Theme](https://drupal.org/project/amptheme) for Drupal 8.

**This theme is not production ready.**

This is an AMP version of the BYU theme. Due to the nature of AMP, it is no where near as flexible as the normal BYU Drupal 8 theme. **You should not and cannot use this as a replacement of that theme.**

This theme requires much of the editing to be done in the code, not in theme settings. It does not use web components (AMP does not allow custom compoents).
